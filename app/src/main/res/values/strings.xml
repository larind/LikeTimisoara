        It is the nucleus from which Timisoara evolved, the first space where people settled and lived continuously on the hearth of the present city.
        Here was also the "Baia Mare", the largest public bath in the city, recently erected by archaeologists, but which is now covered with sand for preservation.
        Liberty shelters some of the oldest buildings in Timisoara: the Garrison Command, the former Chancellery of War - the eastern wing of the Old Town Hall, the Old Town Hall and the Military Casino.</string>
    <string name="victory_square_name">Victory Square</string>
    <string name="victory_square_info">Located in the heart of Timisoara, Victory Square, the newest square in the city, has a special significance for all Romanians, being the place where the Revolutionaries of Timisoara were gathered and where Timisoara was proclaimed on December 20, 1989, the first free city in Romania.
       The Opera Square, as it was said before the Revolution, was designed in 1870, in the hope that the decision to cancel the military fortress would be obtained.
        It was the main boulevard of the city, from the opera and cathedral to the boulevards called "Corso" for the right side, the place of the high society walk, full of luxury shops and restaurants, and "Surogat" for the left, this being a promenade For young people and workers, but also for soldiers, who had to prove that they are on leave to walk.</string>

    <string name="union_square_info">Union Square is considered to be the most beautiful market in Timisoara. It hosts some of the most valuable monuments of Timisoara: Baroque Palace, Catholic Cathedral, Serbian Vicarate, Monument of the Holy Trinity.
                Located in the old town, Unirii Square is one of the oldest, not just the most beautiful. It was named in honor of the Romanian troops that entered Timisoara on 3 August 1919 and established the Romanian administration, thus finalizing the union of Banat with Romania.
                It is also called the "Dome Square" because it hosts the Catholic Dome, built in 1736. It was also called "Hauptplatz", which means the Main Market. For three centuries, Union Square was the site of religious events, military parades, and other prestigious political and cultural events.
                It looks as it is today from 1988-1989, the one who "drew it" being the architect Şerban Sturdza.</string>
