    <string name="bastion_name">Maria Theresia Bastion</string>
    <string name="bastion_info">The Theresia Bastion is the only bastion that still exists in the Timisoara fortress during the period of Banat\'s affiliation to the Austrian Empire.
        \nBeing the only bastion in Timisoara, it is also known by the Timisoara as Fortress Bastion. The bastion was rehabilitated during 2008-2010.
        \nPrior to the rehabilitation, it housed commercial areas, restaurants, bars, a nightclub discotheque, a bookstore, two permanent exhibitions of the Banat Museum, the Information and Communication Technology and "Violin - a Lifetime Passion" Ethnography Section of the Banat Village Museum.</string>
    <string name="timisoreana_name">Timisoreana Brewery</string>
    <string name="timisoreana_info">The first beer factory in Romania has its origins long ago, being established in the city of Timisoara in the second decade of the eighteenth century.
        \nThe first document attesting to this was given by the administration of the fortress and called for the construction of a beer brew and a brandy boiler.
        \nMoreover, the same document prohibits the bringing of beer and brandy elsewhere and specifies the obligation of all the villages of Banat to take on certain quantities of these products on a distribution basis.
        \nThis ordinance was dictated by a necessity: the satisfaction of the needs of the Austrian troops left after the liberation from the Ottoman occupation, as well as the substitution of the acute shortage of drinking water, which also led to the development of a series of projects for feeding the Citadel with water through wooden pipes Building a water tower fueled by Bega.
        \nBeer brewing was built in Palanca Noua, the district that is now called Fabric.</string>
    <string name="history_content">Timisoara is the current residence of Timis County, located in the West part of the country, in the Plain of Timis, a plain of two important rivers: Bega and Timiş.
        \nOn the banks of these rivers, a fortified fortress was built - Castrum Temesiense - a well-known fortress in 1212.The fortress developed over time, reaching between 1315-1323 to be the royal residence of King Charles Robert of Anjou.
        \nTimisoara is first celebrated as Civitas (city) in 1342, and in the 16th century it becomes an important point of resistance against the Ottoman Empire, hence the Crusaders in the Christian War, which ended with the defeat at Nicopole. Also from here starts the military campaign led by Iancu de Hunedoara.
        \nDuring the Peasant War (1382-1390, war against feudal exploitation) led by Gheorghe Doja, Timisoara fortress was besieged and several fortified points were occupied. This was for centuries a bastion of Christian civilization, but in 1552 the city was besieged and taught to the Ottomans, and was released from Turkish domination in 1716 by Prince Eugene of Savoya. Thus, he comes under Habsburg rule.
        \nUnder the Habsburg Empire, Timisoara is headed by a military administration, having as governor the Count Mercy Cavalry General. Then Timisoara began an unprecedented flowering process: profound transformations began in the organization of villages and towns, schools, hospitals, churches and monuments were built, and the Transylvania Barracks, with a length of 483 meters, was the longest building Of Europe at that time.
        \nAt that time colonization of Banat villages and towns began with Swabians, Slovaks and Italians, populations that overlapped the already existing population of Romanians, Serbs, Hungarians, Greeks and Jews.
        \nThus, Banat becomes a land of tolerance, inter-ethnic understanding, respect and collaboration between people, regardless of nationality or religion.</string>
